They are best known for the large, canine-like tusks (often called caniniforms) in both upper and lower jaws. There were no teeth in the front of the jaws, where a hard beak was used to crop vegetation. There were three premaxillary teeth, with the first two small and conical and the third enlarged to form the upper caniniform, counterpart to the even larger lower caniniform, which was the first dentary tooth. In the upper jaw, a large gap (or diastema) accommodated the lower caniniform tooth and separated the premaxillary teeth from the wider chewing teeth of the maxilla. Similar teeth lined the remainder of the lower jaw.

Sampson; the generic name means \\\"Achelous lizard\\\", in reference to the Greek deity Achelous, and the specific name refers to Horner. The genus is known from a few specimens consisting mainly of skull material from individuals, ranging from juveniles to adults. A large centrosaurine, Achelousaurus supposedly was about 6 m (20 ft) long, with a weight of about 3 t (3.3 short tons). As a ceratopsian, it walked on all fours, had a short tail and a large head with a hooked beak. It had a bony neck-frill at the rear of the skull, which sported a pair of long spikes, which curved towards the outside. Adult Achelousaurus had rough bosses (roundish protuberances) above the eyes and on the snout where other centrosaurines often had horns in the same positions. These bosses were covered by a thick layer of keratin, but their exact shape in life is uncertain. Some researchers hypothesize that the bosses were used in fights, with the animals butting each other's heads, as well as for display.\",\n        \"image\": \"https://brunosouzadev-dinoapi.s3.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/images/achelousaurus.jpg\",\n        \"isPopular\": false,\n        \"createdAt\": \"2024-01-20T23:11:11.389Z\",\n        \"updatedAt\": \"2024-01-20T23:11:11.390Z\",\n        \"__v\": 0\n    },\n    {\n        \"_id\": \"65af156b784e13b0a5e697cb\",\n        \"name\": \"acheroraptor\",\n        \"weight\": \"30kg\",\n        \"height\": \"0.8m\",\n        \"length\": \"3m\",\n        \"diet\": \"carnivore\",\n        \"period\": \"late cretaceous\",\n        \"existed\": \"70.6 - 66 million years ago\",\n        \"region\": \"north america\",\n        \"type\": \"terrestrial\",\n        \"description\": \"Acheroraptor was the first confirmed genus of dromaeosaurid dinosaur to be known as coming from the world famous Hell Creek Formation of North America.\\u202d \\u202cDromaeosaurid teeth had been known before this time,\\u202d \\u202cbut they had often been presumed to have come from either Dromaeosaurus or Saurornitholestes,\\u202d \\u202cthough these teeth are now more commonly referred to Acheroraptor.\\n\\nAt the time of writing Acheroraptor is only known from a maxilla and dentary with additional referred teeth.\\u202d \\u202cThese however have been enough to at least confirm that Acheroraptor was actually a North American cousin of the famous Velociraptor that lived in Asia.\\u202d \\u202cComparison of the known Acheroraptor fossils at least suggest that the total length of the holotype individual of Acheroraptor would have been somewhere in the region of about two meters in length.

They are best known for the large, canine-like tusks (often called caniniforms) in both upper and lower jaws. There were no teeth in the front of the jaws, where a hard beak was used to crop vegetation. There were three premaxillary teeth, with the first two small and conical and the third enlarged to form the upper caniniform, counterpart to the even larger lower caniniform, which was the first dentary tooth. In the upper jaw, a large gap (or diastema) accommodated the lower caniniform tooth and separated the premaxillary teeth from the wider chewing teeth of the maxilla.

Sampson; the generic name means \\\"Achelous lizard\\\", in reference to the Greek deity Achelous, and the specific name refers to Horner. The genus is known from a few specimens consisting mainly of skull material from individuals, ranging from juveniles to adults. A large centrosaurine, Achelousaurus supposedly was about 6 m (20 ft) long, with a weight of about 3 t (3.3 short tons). As a ceratopsian, it walked on all fours, had a short tail and a large head with a hooked beak. It had a bony neck-frill at the rear of the skull, which sported a pair of long spikes, which curved towards the outside. Adult Achelousaurus had rough bosses (roundish protuberances) above the eyes and on the snout where other centrosaurines often had horns in the same positions. These bosses were covered by a thick layer of keratin, but their exact shape in life is uncertain. Some researchers hypothesize that the bosses were used in fights, with the animals butting each other's heads, as well as for display.\",\n        \"image\": \"https://brunosouzadev-dinoapi.s3.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/images/achelousaurus.jpg\",\n        \"isPopular\": false,\n        \"createdAt\": \"2024-01-20T23:11:11.389Z\",\n        \"updatedAt\": \"2024-01-20T23:11:11.390Z\",\n        \"__v\": 0\n    },\n    {\n        \"_id\": \"65af156b784e13b0a5e697cb\",\n        \"name\": \"acheroraptor\",\n        \"weight\": \"30kg\",\n        \"height\": \"0.8m\",\n        \"length\": \"3m\",\n        \"diet\": \"carnivore\",\n        \"period\": \"late cretaceous\",\n        \"existed\": \"70.6 - 66 million years ago\",\n        \"region\": \"north america\",\n        \"type\": \"terrestrial\",\n        \"description\": \"Acheroraptor was the first confirmed genus of dromaeosaurid dinosaur to be known as coming from the world famous Hell Creek Formation of North America.\\u202d \\u202cDromaeosaurid teeth had been known before this time,\\u202d \\u202cbut they had often been presumed to have come from either Dromaeosaurus or Saurornitholestes,\\u202d \\u202cthough these teeth are now more commonly referred to Acheroraptor.\\n\\nAt the time of writing Acheroraptor is only known from a maxilla and dentary with additional referred teeth.\\u202d \\u202cThese however have been enough to at least confirm that Acheroraptor was actually a North American cousin of the famous Velociraptor that lived in Asia.\\u202d \\u202cComparison of the known Acheroraptor fossils at least suggest that the total length of the holotype individual of Acheroraptor would have been somewhere in the region of about two meters in length.
